    // Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming(OOP).
    // In C#, encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class.
    // It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, which is achieved by using access modifiers.
    // This way, you can control how the data in your objects is accessed and modified.



    // Encapsulation also involves restricting access to certain components of an object to ensure that the internal implementation
    // details are hidden from the outside world, which is known as data hiding.


    // in Encapsulation we can group data members and function to a single entity. like claass.
    // class is mean to archive Encapsulation.

    // Key Concepts of Encapsulation:
    // Data Hiding:
            // Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal state of an object and only expose the necessary parts to the outside world.
            // This is achieved using access modifiers(like private, protected, internal, public).

            // For example, by marking a field as private, it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
            // Instead, you provide public methods(getters and setters) to access or modify the private data.
