            // Key Features of Constructors.

            // A constructor must have the same name as the class in which it is defined.
            // Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
            // Constructors are called automatically when an object of the class is instantiated.
            // You can define multiple constructors in a class with different parameters (constructor overloading).
            // If no constructor is defined, the compiler provides a default constructor that initializes fields to their default values.



            // Constructors initialize objects and set up initial values.
            // They can be default, parameterized, static, or copy constructors.
            // Constructor overloading allows multiple constructors with different parameters.
            // Constructor chaining allows constructors to call each other using this.
